# Interface Stage Tasks

Use this guidance for tasks focused on UI components, forms, displays, and user-facing elements.

## Before Starting

1. Read existing components to understand styling patterns
2. Check component library or design system being used
3. Review form patterns if building forms
4. Look at similar UI elements for consistency

## Focus Areas

- **Visual Consistency** - Match existing UI patterns
- **Accessibility** - Follow existing a11y patterns
- **Responsiveness** - Match existing responsive behavior
- **State Management** - Use existing state management patterns

## Common Patterns to Preserve

- Component structure: Match existing component organization
- Styling: Use existing CSS/styling approach
- Form handling: Follow existing form patterns
- Loading states: Match existing loading indicator patterns
- Error display: Use existing error message components

## Verification

- Component renders correctly
- Styling matches existing patterns
- Interactive elements work (clicks, hovers, etc.)
- Responsive behavior works on different screen sizes
- Typecheck passes
- **Verify in browser using dev-browser skill** (required for all UI tasks)
