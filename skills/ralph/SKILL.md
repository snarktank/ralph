# Ralph PRD Converter

Converts existing PRDs to the prd.json format that Ralph uses for autonomous execution.

---

## The Job

Take a PRD (markdown file or text) and convert it to `prd.json` in your ralph directory.

---

## Output Format

```json
{
  "project": "[Project Name]",
  "branchName": "ralph/[feature-name-kebab-case]",
  "description": "[Feature description from PRD title/intro]",
  "userStories": [
    {
      "id": "US-001",
      "title": "[Story title]",
      "description": "As a [user], I want [feature] so that [benefit]",
      "acceptanceCriteria": [
        "Criterion 1",
        "Criterion 2",
        "Typecheck passes"
      ],
      "priority": 1,
      "passes": false,
      "notes": ""
    }
  ]
}
```

## Story Size: The Number One Rule

**Each story must be completable in ONE Ralph iteration (one context window).**

Ralph spawns a fresh Amp instance per iteration with no memory of previous work. If a story is too big, the LLM runs out of context before finishing and produces broken code.

### Right-sized stories:
- Add a database column and migration
- Add a UI component to an existing page
- Update a server action with new logic
- Add a filter dropdown to a list

### Too big (split these):
- "Build the entire dashboard" - Split into: schema, queries, UI components, filters
- "Add authentication" - Split into: schema, middleware, login UI, session handling
- "Refactor the API" - Split into one story per endpoint or pattern

**Rule of thumb:** If you cannot describe the change in 2-3 sentences, it is too big.

---

## Story Ordering: Dependencies First

Stories execute in priority order. Earlier stories must not depend on later ones.

**Correct order:**
1. Schema/database changes (migrations)
2. Server actions / backend logic
3. UI components that use the backend
4. Dashboard/summary views that aggregate data

**Wrong order:**
1. UI component (depends on schema that does not exist yet)
2. Schema change

---

## Acceptance Criteria: Must Be Verifiable

Each criterion must be something Ralph can CHECK, not something vague.

### Good criteria (verifiable):
- "Add `status` column to tasks table with default 'pending'"
- "Filter dropdown has options: All, Active, Completed"
- "Clicking delete shows confirmation dialog"
- "Typecheck passes"
- "Tests pass"

### Bad criteria (vague):
- "Works correctly"
- "User can do X easily"
- "Good UX"
- "Handles edge cases"

### Always include as final criterion:
```
"Typecheck passes"
```

For stories with testable logic, also include:
```
"Tests pass"
```

### For stories that change UI, also include:
```
"Verify in browser using dev-browser skill"
```

Frontend stories are NOT complete until visually verified. Ralph will use the dev-browser skill to navigate to the page, interact with the UI, and confirm changes work.

---

## Conversion Rules

1. **Each user story becomes one JSON entry**
2. **IDs**: Sequential (US-001, US-002, etc.)
3. **Priority**: Based on dependency order, then document order
4. **All stories**: `passes: false` and empty `notes`
5. **branchName**: Derive from feature name, kebab-case, prefixed with `ralph/`
6. **Always add**: "Typecheck passes" to every story's acceptance criteria

---

## Splitting Large PRDs

If a PRD has big features, split them:

**Original:**
> "Add user notification system"

**Split into:**
1. US-001: Add notifications table to database
2. US-002: Create notification service for sending notifications
3. US-003: Add notification bell icon to header
4. US-004: Create notification dropdown panel
5. US-005: Add mark-as-read functionality
6. US-006: Add notification preferences page

Each is one focused change that can be completed and verified independently.

## Example

**Input PRD:**
```markdown
# Task Status Feature

Add ability to mark tasks with different statuses.

## Requirements
- Toggle between pending/in-progress/done on task list
- Filter list by status
- Show status badge on each task
- Persist status in database
```

**Output prd.json:**
```json

  "project": "TaskApp",

  "userStories": [
    {

    },
    {
      "id": "US-004",

      "description": "As a user, I want to filter the list to see only certain statuses.",
      "acceptanceCriteria": [
        "Filter dropdown: All | Pending | In Progress | Done",
        "Filter persists in URL params",
        "Typecheck passes",

      ],
      "priority": 4,
      "passes": false,

    }
  ]
}
```

## Archiving Previous Runs

**Before writing a new prd.json, check if there is an existing one from a different feature:**

1. Read the current `prd.json` if it exists
2. Check if `branchName` differs from the new feature's branch name
3. If different AND `progress.txt` has content beyond the header:
   - Create archive folder: `archive/YYYY-MM-DD-feature-name/`
   - Copy current `prd.json` and `progress.txt` to archive
   - Reset `progress.txt` with fresh header

**The ralph.sh script handles this automatically** when you run it, but if you are manually updating prd.json between runs, archive first.

## Task Generation (Claude Code Integration)

**After writing prd.json, automatically create Claude Code tasks:**

If Claude Code is available and Node.js is installed:

1. **Run the conversion script**:
   ```bash
   node scripts/prd-to-tasks.js prd.json
   ```

2. **Verify task creation**:
   - Script should output summary: "X parent tasks, Y child tasks, Z dependencies"
   - Check for errors (circular dependencies, missing stories, etc.)

3. **Display next steps**:
   ```
   Tasks created successfully!

   Task Summary:
     - User stories: X
     - Acceptance criteria: Y
     - Dependencies detected: Z

   To run Ralph:
     ./ralph.sh --tool claude [max_iterations]

   To view tasks:
     claude task list
   ```

**Task Structure Created:**
- **Parent tasks**: One per user story (e.g., `[US-001] Add status field to database`)
- **Child tasks**: One per acceptance criterion (e.g., `[US-001-AC1] Add status column with migration`)
- **Dependencies**: Auto-detected based on keywords in story content
  - Schema stories (database, migration, table) → No dependencies (foundational)
  - Backend stories (API, endpoint, server action) → Depend on schema stories
  - UI stories (component, page, form, button) → Depend on backend + schema stories

**Dependency Detection Keywords:**
- Explicit: `requires US-001`, `depends on US-002`, `after US-003`
- Schema: `database`, `migration`, `table`, `column`, `schema`
- Backend: `API`, `endpoint`, `server action`, `backend`, `service`
- UI: `component`, `page`, `form`, `button`, `dropdown`, `modal`, `display`

**Manual Dependency Override:**

If automatic detection is insufficient, add `dependencies` field to stories in prd.json:

```json
{
  "id": "US-003",
  "title": "Add status toggle UI",
  "dependencies": ["US-001", "US-002"],
  "acceptanceCriteria": [...]
}
```

**Error Handling:**

If task creation fails:
- **Node.js not installed**: Skip task creation, use prd.json-only mode
- **Claude Code not available**: Skip task creation, use prd.json-only mode
- **Circular dependency detected**: Script will error, fix prd.json story ordering
- **Validation errors**: Script will error with details, fix prd.json structure

Ralph will automatically fall back to prd.json-only mode if tasks are unavailable.

## Checklist Before Saving

Before writing prd.json, verify:

- [ ] **Previous run archived** (if prd.json exists with different branchName, archive it first)
- [ ] Each story is completable in one iteration (small enough)
- [ ] Stories are ordered by dependency (schema to backend to UI)
- [ ] Every story has "Typecheck passes" as criterion
- [ ] UI stories have "Verify in browser using dev-browser skill" as criterion
- [ ] Acceptance criteria are verifiable (not vague)
- [ ] No story depends on a later story
- [ ] **Task generation**: After saving prd.json, run `node scripts/prd-to-tasks.js prd.json` (if Claude Code available)
