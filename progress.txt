# Ralph Progress Log
Started: Sat Jan 18 2026
Feature: Docker Build Optimization
---

## Codebase Patterns
- This is a Rust project - use `cargo check` for typechecking, `cargo clippy -- -D warnings` for linting, `cargo fmt` for formatting
- Dockerfile uses multi-stage builds with BuildKit syntax
- GitHub Actions workflow at `.github/workflows/docker.yml`
- Docker MCP toolkit expects mcp.server and mcp.transport labels
