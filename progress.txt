# Ralph Progress Log
Started: Sat Jan 18 2026
Feature: Error Recovery System
---

## Codebase Patterns
- This is a Rust project - use `cargo check` for typechecking, `cargo clippy -- -D warnings` for linting, `cargo fmt` for formatting
- Modules follow pattern: `mod.rs` with re-exports, submodules in same directory
- Error handling uses `thiserror` crate with custom error enums
- MCP tools follow pattern in `src/mcp/tools/` with JSON schema derive
- Quality gates defined in `src/quality/` with profile-based configuration
- Recovery module goes in `src/recovery/` following audit module pattern
- Checkpoint files stored in `.ralph/` directory
