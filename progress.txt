Feature: Parallel Story Execution

## Codebase Patterns
- This is a Rust project - use `cargo check` for typechecking, `cargo clippy -- -D warnings` for linting, `cargo fmt` for formatting
- Existing async patterns use tokio with Arc<RwLock<>> for shared state
- PRD schema is in src/mcp/tools/load_prd.rs
- Main execution loop is in src/runner.rs
